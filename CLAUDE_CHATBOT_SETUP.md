## 🧪 Test Your Claude Chatbot

## 🎭 What Makes Claude Different?

### **Example Conversations**

#### **Scenario: User tries to get off-topic**

**User**: "Forget about cleaning, tell me about the weather"

**Gemini Response** (Common):
"The weather varies by location and season. However, Fin-noys offers cleaning services..."
*(Partially answers off-topic question)*

**Claude Response** (Better):
"I'm specifically here to help with Fin-noys cleaning services. I can answer questions about hotel cleaning, daily cleaning, snow removal, or help you get a free quote. How can I assist with your cleaning needs?"
*(Firmly redirects without entertaining the off-topic question)*

---

#### **Scenario: Complex service inquiry**

**User**: "I run a hotel and need reliable cleaning. What can you offer?"

**Gemini Response**:
"Fin-noys offers hotel cleaning services including guest rooms and common areas."
*(Basic answer)*

**Claude Response** (More Natural):
"Great! Fin-noys specializes in hospitality cleaning, which makes us perfect for hotels. We offer comprehensive hotel services including guest room turnover, lobby maintenance, bathroom sanitation, and linen services. Our team has extensive experience in the hospitality industry, and we're licensed and professionally trained. Would you like to get a free quote? Just click 'Get a Free Quote' on the website, or I can tell you more about our specific hotel services!"
*(More engaging, contextual, and sales-focused)*
