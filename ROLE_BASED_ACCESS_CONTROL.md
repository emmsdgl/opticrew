# Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Implementation

**Date**: October 24, 2025
**Status**: ‚úÖ **Implemented and Active**

---

## üéØ Problem Solved

**Before**: Any authenticated user (admin, employee, or external_client) could access ANY route, including admin-only pages.

**After**: Each user role can only access routes appropriate for their role. Unauthorized access attempts are automatically redirected to the user's proper dashboard with an error message.

---

## üîí Security Middleware Created

### 1. **CheckAdmin Middleware** (`app/Http/Middleware/CheckAdmin.php`)
- **Purpose**: Only allows users with `role = 'admin'` to proceed
- **Protects**: All admin routes (dashboard, tasks, optimization, analytics, etc.)
- **Redirects**:
  - Employees ‚Üí Employee dashboard with error message
  - External clients ‚Üí Client dashboard with error message
  - Unauthenticated ‚Üí Login page

### 2. **CheckEmployee Middleware** (`app/Http/Middleware/CheckEmployee.php`)
- **Purpose**: Only allows users with `role = 'employee'` to proceed
- **Protects**: All employee routes (dashboard, attendance, tasks, performance)
- **Redirects**:
  - Admins ‚Üí Admin dashboard with error message
  - External clients ‚Üí Client dashboard with error message
  - Unauthenticated ‚Üí Login page

### 3. **CheckClient Middleware** (`app/Http/Middleware/CheckClient.php`)
- **Purpose**: Only allows users with `role = 'external_client'` to proceed
- **Protects**: All client routes (dashboard, appointments, booking)
- **Redirects**:
  - Admins ‚Üí Admin dashboard with error message
  - Employees ‚Üí Employee dashboard with error message
  - Unauthenticated ‚Üí Login page

## üß™ How to Test Security

### Test 1: External Client Cannot Access Admin Routes
1. **Sign up as external client** (or use existing client account)
2. **Try to access admin route** directly in browser:
   ```
   http://localhost/admin/dashboard
   http://localhost/tasks
   http://localhost/analytics
   ```
3. **Expected Result**:
   - Redirected to `/client/dashboard`
   - Error message shown: "Unauthorized: Admin access required."

### Test 2: Employee Cannot Access Admin Routes
1. **Login as employee**
2. **Try to access admin route**:
   ```
   http://localhost/admin/dashboard
   http://localhost/admin/optimization/check-unsaved
   ```
3. **Expected Result**:
   - Redirected to `/employee/dashboard`
   - Error message shown: "Unauthorized: Admin access required."

### Test 3: Admin Cannot Access Client Routes (Optional Test)
1. **Login as admin**
2. **Try to access client route**:
   ```
   http://localhost/client/dashboard
   ```
3. **Expected Result**:
   - Redirected to `/admin/dashboard`
   - Error message shown: "Unauthorized: Client access required."

### Test 4: Unauthenticated Users Cannot Access Protected Routes
1. **Logout** (or use incognito browser)
2. **Try to access any protected route**:
   ```
   http://localhost/admin/dashboard
   http://localhost/employee/dashboard
   http://localhost/client/dashboard
   ```
3. **Expected Result**:
   - Redirected to login page

## üìÅ Files Modified

### New Files Created (3 middleware classes):
1. `app/Http/Middleware/CheckAdmin.php` - Admin role check
2. `app/Http/Middleware/CheckEmployee.php` - Employee role check
3. `app/Http/Middleware/CheckClient.php` - Client role check

### Modified Files (2 files):
1. **`app/Http/Kernel.php`**
   - **Lines changed**: 71-74
   - **Change**: Registered 3 new middleware in `$routeMiddleware` array
   ```php
   // Role-based access control middleware
   'admin' => \App\Http\Middleware\CheckAdmin::class,
   'employee' => \App\Http\Middleware\CheckEmployee::class,
   'client' => \App\Http\Middleware\CheckClient::class,
   ```

2. **`routes/web.php`**
   - **Lines changed**: 69, 145, 168
   - **Admin routes** (line 69): Changed from `middleware(['auth'])` to `middleware(['auth', 'admin'])`
   - **Employee routes** (line 145): Changed from `middleware(['auth'])` to `middleware(['auth', 'employee'])`
   - **Client routes** (line 168): Added `middleware(['auth', 'client'])` wrapper

---

## üîç How It Works

### Before (Vulnerable):
```php
Route::middleware(['auth'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/admin/dashboard', ...);  // Any authenticated user can access
});
```

### After (Secure):
```php
Route::middleware(['auth', 'admin'])->group(function () {
    Route::get('/admin/dashboard', ...);  // Only admins can access
});
```

### Middleware Execution Flow:
1. **Request comes in** ‚Üí `/admin/dashboard`
2. **`auth` middleware runs** ‚Üí Check if user is logged in
   - If not logged in ‚Üí Redirect to login
   - If logged in ‚Üí Continue
3. **`admin` middleware runs** ‚Üí Check if user has admin role
   - If role = 'admin' ‚Üí Allow access ‚úÖ
   - If role = 'employee' ‚Üí Redirect to employee dashboard ‚ùå
   - If role = 'external_client' ‚Üí Redirect to client dashboard ‚ùå

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Your Feedback Navigation Issue:
You mentioned: *"I tried signing up as an external client, and I navigated on Feedbacks on my slider and it redirects me to my analysis page on Admin"*

**What this security fix does:**
- ‚úÖ **Prevents backend access**: External clients can no longer access `/analytics` or any admin route via direct URL
- ‚úÖ **Shows error message**: Users are redirected with "Unauthorized: Admin access required."
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Does NOT fix frontend routing**: You mentioned you'll fix the Feedbacks button routing yourself

**What you still need to fix:**
- The frontend navigation link in your slider that points to the admin analysis page
- Update the client-side route/link to point to the correct client page or remove it entirely

---

## üéØ Security Benefits

1. **URL Protection**: Users cannot bypass UI and access routes via direct URL manipulation
2. **Role Enforcement**: Database role values (`admin`, `employee`, `external_client`) are enforced at route level
3. **Automatic Redirection**: Wrong role users are automatically sent to their appropriate dashboard
4. **Clear Error Messages**: Users see why they were denied access
5. **Defense in Depth**: Works alongside existing policies and validation

---

## üß© Integration with Existing Security

This RBAC middleware works **in addition to** your existing security layers:

1. **Authorization Policies** (created earlier):
   - `TaskPolicy` - Controls task CRUD operations
   - `OptimizationRunPolicy` - Controls optimization operations
   - `EmployeePolicy` - Controls employee data access

2. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Task creation: 20 requests/minute
   - Optimization: 5 requests/minute
   - API routes: 60 requests/minute

3. **Form Request Validation**:
   - `StoreTaskRequest` - Validates task creation
   - `UpdateTaskStatusRequest` - Validates status updates
   - `SaveScheduleRequest` - Validates schedule saving

**Combined Effect**: Multi-layered security where each layer provides a different type of protection.

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Too many redirects" error
**Cause**: Middleware redirecting in a loop
**Fix**: Clear browser cache and cookies, or use incognito mode

### Issue: Still able to access admin routes as client
**Cause**: Cache not cleared
**Fix**: Run `php artisan optimize:clear`

### Issue: Getting "Invalid user role" and logged out
**Cause**: User's `role` column in database has unexpected value
**Fix**: Check database - ensure role is exactly `'admin'`, `'employee'`, or `'external_client'` (case-sensitive)

### Issue: Error message not showing after redirect
**Cause**: Flash message session not configured
**Fix**: Ensure your views display flash messages:
```php
@if (session('error'))
    <div class="alert alert-danger">{{ session('error') }}</div>
@endif
```

## üöÄ Next Steps

   - Try accessing admin routes directly in browser
   - Verify you're redirected to client dashboard with error
