 * @deprecated This model is deprecated and will be removed in a future version.
 * Use App\Models\OptimizationTeam and App\Models\OptimizationTeamMember instead.
 *
 * The new optimization system (based on the pseudocode) uses:
 * - OptimizationTeam: Represents a team created by the optimization algorithm
 * - OptimizationTeamMember: Represents employees in that team
 *
 * This model is kept temporarily for backward compatibility with old task assignments.
 * All new task assignments should use the OptimizationTeam structure.
