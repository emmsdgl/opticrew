**Algorithm Comparison Flow**



The purpose of the algorithm comparison of genetic algorithm with the hybrid approach of genetic algorithm + rule-based will only be within the scope of predicting the following:



1. **Workforce Size** *(would optimize the system by reducing overstaffing or understaffing.)*
2. **Employees Per Task** *(would optimize the system by workload balancing, ensuring tasks are neither under-resourced (which might cause delays) nor over-resourced (which wastes workforce capacity))*
3. **Task Allocation** (all real-time and pre-added tasks are assigned wit prioritization being applied correctly for urgent tasks)

Â 

**Results of the Algorithm Comparison**



**a. Prediction Accuracy** - Calculate MAE or RMSE for workforce size and task staffing predictions (lower MAE (Mean Absolute Error) or RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) corresponds to better accuracy)



uses TaskDurationHours, EmployeeWorkSpeed, EmployeeAssigned, WorkforceSize for comparing predicted vs actual workforce and task loads.



**b. Allocation Efficiency** - Measure the percentage of tasks successfully assigned within a specific timeframe



uses TaskCompletionStatus and timestamps to measure percentage of tasks completed on time.



**c. Computational Time** - Record time taken by each system to produce its optimal solution



can be logged separately during model processing (not in dataset).



**d. Cost Efficiency** - base this metric on the salary computation and reduced average idle times, no need to consider the materials and other resources used



calculated from EmployeeHoursWorked, EmployeeHourlySalary, and TotalIdleTimeMinutes to reflect actual salary costs versus potential.

**Algorithm Flow (Rule-based + Genetic Algorithm)**

**Genetic Algorithm (Without Prediction)**



1. **initialize population** (create a set of possible task assignments, workforce size, and scheduling)

--> **define chromosome structure** (workforce size is computed, an allocation layout is generated based on constraints)

--> **rule-based filtering** (rule-based algo is applied to further clean the assignments)

--> **diversify population**: 50% will be based on heuristic constraints ng system while 50% will be randomized

--> generate population



2\. apply rule-based to filter the generated solutions

3\. run the greedy algorithm for the filtered ones (until convergence (little or no fitness improvement over several generations)

4\. use mutation with controlled rate (Introduce random changes to workforce size, task assignments, or schedule times per iteration)

5\. employ crossover diversity (per iteration)

6\. after running the GA 10 times, calculate the fitness values of all candidate solutions and get the highest-ranking solution



**More Detailed:**



1. **Initialization** : Initialize population of potential solutions (chromosomes) where each chromosome encodes task assignments and workforce size. Define task characteristics: when, where, size/type, priority, duration, urgency
2. **Rule-Based Preprocessing** : Apply business rules to filter feasible assignments (e.g., RoomType, TaskPriority, IsUrgent, EmployeeWorkSpeed).
3. **Workforce Size Prediction**: Predict and store how many workers are needed for the task
4. **Task Allocation**: Assign specific employees to tasks (with IDs), link assignment status
5. **Employee Work Speed \& Hours**	: Evaluate employee speed for task timing and cost, track hours worked and salary for optimization
6. **Scheduling Times** : Set and adjust the start and end times for the scheduled tasks
7. **Idle Time Calculation** : Calculate and store idle time (when employee is not working) to balance and optimize scheduling
8. **Task Status Monitoring**: Track if a task is completed or pending, useful for iterative scheduling and follow-up
